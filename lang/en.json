It’s the skill that turns ideas into reality. When you learn coding, you learn how to think differently. You don’t just follow instructions — you solve problems, create things from nothing, and make technology work for you. From designing your own website to building smart systems that help people, coding gives you the power to shape the world around you. The earlier you start, the stronger your digital creativity becomes — and the future belongs to creators.",
